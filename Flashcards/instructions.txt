Creating a new deck:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a new xml file in the decks folder and call it whatever you would like the name
of the deck to be. It is recommended that you copy an existing deck and rename it.

2. Open the xml file in a text editor. Notepad will work, but Notepad++ is recommended.

3. If you are creating a new xml file instead of copying one, then copy and paste the 
following code into the file:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <deck>
        <card front="" back = ""></card>
    </deck>

4. Quick note about cards: The front is the side that the user is to be quizzed on, and 
the back is the "answer" that the user must guess.

5. Place the text that you want to be on the front in the quotes in front of front, and
do the same for the back:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <deck>
        <card front="Hola" back = "Hello"></card>
    </deck>

6. Congratulations! You have added your first card! To add more, simply copy the card line
and change the front and back text like you did before:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <deck>
        <card front="Hola" back = "Hello"></card>
        <card front="Como Estas?" back = "How are you?"></card>
        <card front="Voy a cortarle la cabeza." back = "I am going to cut off your head"></card>
    </deck>



Running the Quiz:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Double-click on the file "Flashcards.jar" to open the program.

2. Enter the name of your deck in the text box. If the name that you type doesn't exist,
the computer will get mad at you and say that the file is invalid.

3. When the quiz starts, you will see the first card. Your job is to try and guess what's
on the other side of that card. Type your answer in the text box and hit enter (or click
the "Next" button).

4. The program will tell you whether you were right or wrong, and correct you if you were
wrong. Hit the enter key or hit next again to move on to the next card. Repeat this
process until you've gone through the entire deck.

5. When you're done, you have the option to either quiz yourself on the entire deck,
quiz yourself on just the cards you got wrong, or quit the program. Click whichever button
corresponds to your selection, or hit enter to quiz yourself on the wrongly answered
cards.
